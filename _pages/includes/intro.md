# ðŸ“– About me
Hello world! I'm a junior undergraduate student at [Xingjian College, Tsinghua University](https://www.xjc.tsinghua.edu.cn/). My research interests lie at the intersection of vision and machine learning. My research objective is to build an embodied system that can independently complete the understanding, planning, and decision-making of 3D scenes, and apply it to fields such as robotics and autonomous driving. Now I'm working closely with [Prof.Gao Huang](https://www.gaohuang.net/) and [Prof.Hongsheng Li](http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~hsli/). If you are also interested in this domain, please feel free to contact me.
